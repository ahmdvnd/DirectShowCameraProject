# DirectShow Camera Project
 In this project I have shown how to connect to USB cameras and do some operations by Microsoft DirectShow.
 all codes have been writen on Microsoft Visual Studio and C++ language 
 The operation that this project does are :
  -Connect and find camera by its DevicePath (beccause I have seen some devices with the exactly same PID&VID -Chines one :D- )
  - take images with custome config
   - loading all configs that a camera has
  - Write Text on images
  - Recording video
   -Editing all frames one by one by grabbing frames.
    -write text on live video
